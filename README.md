# Excel_VBA
Assorted tools made using VBA in Excel and Acces created for work in retail. First programming learned this way. Be adviced; spaghetti code in huge quantities.


- **VareAnalyse** Used by many stores to analyse data scraped from SAP. All data backed up in Access and summarized. Made as an interactive workbook with buttons and automizations for several different purposes.
- **VaretellingsAnalyse** Used for inventory analysis. Used by all supermarkets in our company for a few years. Used to better visualize, summarize and unveil errors during inventory-day
- **FokusX** Originally made by a colleague. Used by all supermarkets in company for several years. I took over maintenance and yearly modifications some years ago.
